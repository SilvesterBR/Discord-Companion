# Brief
A repository from a collection of projects I have developed and published in my spare time.

# Discord-Companion
Discord companion is a chat based bot which iteracts with Discords API, a platform to exchange media across the globe and to communicate with others. Users can send commands to this bot and in exchange will recieve up to date content from the Bungie.net API, more specifically the game Destiny 2. This bot also includes a variety of misc commands which allow for fun and interseting interactions with discord.
